README!!

During this assignment, I had a lot of trouble using Jupyter Notebook. For some reason it took up 94% of my laptop's memory (which is VERY strange because my laptop was built for intensive software) and 97% of my disc space. Due to this, it caused my computer to run so slowly that my mouse would not move for minutes at a time. I do not know why this happened. 

As for the assignment itself, I tested the program in 3 different shells and with all three programs the output was identical to what the assignment wanted. But, in Jupyter Notebook, I would always get an error saying the Car class was not defined in the load_cows function. Again, I do not know why this happened, and if you could shed some light on it I would be grateful!

I am attaching screenshots of the correct output running in a different program. Hopefully this works for you.
